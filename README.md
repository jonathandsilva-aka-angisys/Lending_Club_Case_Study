## General Information
#### Business Understanding
We are working for a __consumer finance company__ which specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile.
There are two __types of risks__ that are associated with the bank’s decision:
-  If the applicant is __likely to repay the loan,__ then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
-  If the applicant is __not likely to repay the loan,__ i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

-  If the applicant is __likely to repay the loan,__ then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
-  If the applicant is __not likely to repay the loan,__ i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
