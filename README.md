## General Information
#### Business Understanding
We are working for a __consumer finance company__ which specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile.
There are two __types of risks__ that are associated with the bank’s decision:
-  If the applicant is __likely to repay the loan,__ then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
-  If the applicant is __not likely to repay the loan,__ i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

#### Business Objectives
This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.<br>
The company wants to understand the __driving factors__ (__or driver variables__) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.<br>

#### Problem Statement
__Aim__
- Identify patterns in data which indicate if a loan applicant is likely to default on loan repayment.<br>

__Objective__
- Based on the data available from the consumer finance company, understand the driving variables available at the time of the application and historical data to identify strong indictors of default.<br>

__Approach__
- Utilize the Exploratory Data Analysis concepts learnt to undertake portfolio and risk assessment in the banking and finance sector.<br>

- Loan purpose
